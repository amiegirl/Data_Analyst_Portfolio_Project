# Introduction
This dataset contains information about employees hired between 2000 and 2020. The dataset was provided by Microsoft Learn Ambassadors.<br>
# Objectives
To generate insights and suggest healthy working conditions.<br>
# Research Questions
* What is the age distribution?
* What is the most common gender?
* What is the most common race of employees?
* What is the most common work location?
* What department has the highest number of employees?
* Which state has the highest number of employees?
# Approach
* Processing and Cleaning the dataset
* Performed exploratory data analysis to show gender, age, race, location, state and department of employees hired between 2000 and 2020
# Data Manipulation
* The columns in the dataset are highlighted below
* Remove blank cells, duplicates and inconsistent data
* Age column was created by subtracting the birth date from the hire date. This is to ascertain the age they started working.<br>

# Conclusion and Recommendation
* There was a sharp increase in employees in 2001 and a steady increase afterwards, with 2018 having the highest employment rate
* The majority of the employees are aged between 17 and 36 years. The dataset has extremely low values in the age range. There's is need to find most appropriate dataset for accurate analysis
* There should be a gender balance, as there are more males than females.
* There is an imbalance in the race of employees; the white race seems to be the favorite race.
* Ohio State has the highest number of employees, and the majority of them work at the headquarters. All employees from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennysylvania and Wisconsin states work remotely.
* I suggest improvements in working conditions of employees across the other states to reduce focus and population in Ohio state.
* Give more room for remote work in the other states.
