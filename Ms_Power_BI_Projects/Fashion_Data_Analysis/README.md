# Fashion Data Analysis

# Project Summary

This shows results of data collected from an ecommerce platform. . User-generated content reflects consumersâ€™ most instinctive awareness of products and can be used as an important reference for manufactures to make product decisions.
We can use consumer ratings to evaluate their attitudes towards products. We can also evaluate competing brands and use products rating count to predict product demand and market changes.
We can confirm that several proactive fashion brands such as Roadster, Tokyo Talkies, Sassafras, Vishudh, Anouk, Mitera, Sangria, Street 9, and Kalini (to mention a few) are seen taking full advantage of their online presence.

The counts from the chart of product attributes have shown that several product attributes such as fabric, pattern, occasion, types, measurements, colour, length can indeed help in predicting features of interest for fashion businesses and help forecast product trends, it could also be an effective integral part of subsequent brand designs.

The scatterplot show that relationship exists between average rating of the apparel and their rating count and prices, this can better estimate product demand.

Checking the Effect of Rating and Demand on Price, we could see that most apparel with high prices are poor rated or not rated, apparel with moderate prices is well rated. So, we can conclude that apparel with low and moderate prices is high in demand while apparel with high prices is low in demand.
