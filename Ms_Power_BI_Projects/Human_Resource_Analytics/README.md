# Insights and Recommendation
* A total of 1470 employees were hired between 2012 and 2022 with 1233 active employees and 237 inactive employees.
* The most common job role is software engineering which is in the technology department.
* The majority of the employees are aged between 20 and 29 years.
* There are generally more males than females.
* The average salaries of the white and native hawaiian race are higher than other races.
* Sales representatives and recruiters job roles have the highest attrition rate.
* Attrition rate is high among employees that work overtime. Discuss needs to review employees policies on overtime requirements.
* Organize a meeting with employees with low manager ratings to discuss needs and create an improvement plan.
* Frequent travelers have the highest attrition rate of 24.9%. I suggest a review in the travel requirements policies among employees.
