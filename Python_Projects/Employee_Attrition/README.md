Checking the effect of overtime on employee attrition, we see that employees that work overtime are more affected by 
attrition than employees that do not work overtime.

We can deduce from the bar chart above that the average income of employees with a higher education level is higher than that of employees with a lower education level.
We can deduce from the boxplot that the monthly income of doctoral employees is the highest, followed by master's and then bachelor's.
Below college, college employees earn the lowest monthly income.
Although there are outliers in the below-college, college, bachelor, and Master employee groups,
Most of the data points lie within the box, and this suggests that the higher the education level, the higher the monthly income.
